WIP - svg datavis generator
=============

This is a tiny webtool aiming at connecting google spreadsheets and static data files to svg datavis generators.
It has been built for allowing a smoother workflow between data experts and designers, without loosing fine tuning possibilities hidden by generic datavis tools. 

Workflow : Set params and data source in the 'data/directory.json' file > refine vis filters and options visually > download as svg for further infographics work.
